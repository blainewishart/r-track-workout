# Deployment Strategy

## Google Play Store Deployment

### Initial Deployment
1. **Build APK**: `expo build:android`
2. **Upload to Play Console**: Use internal testing track first
3. **Gradual rollout**: Start with 10% of users
4. **Monitor feedback**: Watch for crashes and user complaints

### Easy Takedown Options

#### Option 1: Immediate Takedown (Recommended)
- **Play Console** → **Release** → **Production** → **Unpublish**
- **Time**: Instant (within minutes)
- **Effect**: App disappears from store, existing users keep it
- **Recovery**: Can republish anytime

#### Option 2: Gradual Rollback
- **Play Console** → **Release** → **Production** → **Rollback**
- **Time**: 24-48 hours
- **Effect**: Reverts to previous version
- **Recovery**: Can roll forward again

#### Option 3: App Deactivation
- **Play Console** → **Setup** → **App content** → **Deactivate app**
- **Time**: Instant
- **Effect**: App completely removed from store
- **Recovery**: Requires reactivation process

### Emergency Procedures

#### If App is Causing Issues:
1. **Immediate**: Unpublish from Play Console
2. **Investigate**: Check crash reports and user feedback
3. **Fix**: Address issues in development
4. **Test**: Thorough testing before republishing
5. **Republish**: Gradual rollout with new version

#### Monitoring Tools:
- **Firebase Crashlytics**: Real-time crash monitoring
- **Play Console Analytics**: User behavior and performance
- **User Reviews**: Direct feedback from users

### Version Management
- **Version Code**: Increment for each release
- **Version Name**: Semantic versioning (1.0.0, 1.0.1, etc.)
- **Release Notes**: Clear description of changes

### Best Practices
1. **Always test on internal track first**
2. **Use gradual rollout for major changes**
3. **Monitor metrics for 24-48 hours after release**
4. **Have rollback plan ready**
5. **Keep previous stable version as backup**
