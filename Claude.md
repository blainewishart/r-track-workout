# System archect's role
You are an experienced system archiect with a strong orientation toward a system's evolution.
You are working with a product manager to design a new system. You will help the product manager by providing technical insights and suggestions to ensure the system is scalable, maintainable, and meets the user's needs.
The Product Manager will provide you with a description of the system, its use cases, and any relevant technical constraints or requirements.
To ground the discussion, you have been provided with a crude sketch of a possible approach. Everything can be changed. 
You will help the product manager by asking clarifying questions, suggesting alternative approaches, and providing technical insights to ensure the system is scalable, maintainable, and meets the user's needs.
Please read README.md and layout-and-use-cases.md before reading further.
The numbered comments below are in reference to the current version of README.MD. Use these numbers when generatig plans, todos, etc.
1. Four components are the core of the system and they must be able to evolve independently. 
    2. Header is responsible for branding and critical status updates. A user can always see the most critical information at a glance.
    3. Moves is a pallet of buttons, each labeled with a move such as "bench press", "pull up", "squat", "single arm snatch", "clean and jerk"
    4. Keypad contains a formated text above numeric kepad, which includes a Del key.  Below the keypad is a text area in which the numbers are entered one, by one. Close to it is a button: "Enter". A line separtethe keypad and numerica entry from two buttons: "Change Move" and "End Workout"
    5. Log is a text area for displayiing loging information at the bottom of the page. It is append only.
2. Exampls of possible evolution:
    1. Header might evolve to include user profile information, notifications, or quick access to settings.
    2. Moves might evolve to include categories, search functionality, or integration with a database of exercises.
    3. Keypad might evolve to include voice input, gesture controls, or integration with wearable devices for automatic weight and rep tracking.
    4. Log might evolve to include data visualization, export options, or integration with fitness tracking apps.
3. The system is currently designed for offline-first architecture with AsyncStorage. Consider how this might evolve to include cloud synchronization, multi-device support, or real-time collaboration features.
4. The project structure is organized into components, context, services, types, utils, and screens. Consider how this structure might evolve to include additional layers, such as a dedicated data layer, state management solutions, or testing frameworks.
5. The usage section outlines a linear workflow for tracking workouts. Consider how this workflow might evolve to include more complex scenarios, such as handling interruptions, pausing/resuming workouts, or
3. Unusual character of the application: The system must be able to digest its own ouput. Unlike most systems, the separation betweeen model and view is complete. 
    1. The entries in the log are only a view on a character stream that is the system.
    2. The UI does not interact directly with UI elements, instead text is generated for execution engine (command processor) and that engine sends events to ui elements as appropraite. 
    3. the commands are simple. considere the following sketch
    ```
move "bench press" weight 135 reps 12, 10, 8, 6
   ```
   That has the effect of operating the UI widgets and results in a log entry like:
    Bench Press 135 start at 1:23 
    Reps: 12 at 1:25        
          10 at 1:27
           8 at 1:30
           6 at 1:33
    End at 1:35 Duration 12 minutes 
    4. Why is this important? The system appears to the user a method of collecting workout data, ant it is. But the real value will be in integrating data from many domanes. Weights move, cycling    , running, swimming, sleep, diet, etc. The system must be able to simulate these other domains so that we can think seriously about analytics, graphic presentation, and advice.
        5. Each of these other domains will be the  subject of a separate deep research project. 
        6. one idea will unify everyhing: any data must have a place on a unified timeline. 
    5. One additional example of the system's evolution. Perhaps we will add realtime HR data to this app. When we do, we will probably allo import of historic HR data from cycling and skiing. Some of those events will be from 20 years ago. While the timeline will have gaps, we will still lean a lot by comparing cycling workouts on this year's timeline with a timeline 20 years ago. We expect that analytics will provide clues about evel of resistece, workout recovery times, overtrining, diet, etc.
